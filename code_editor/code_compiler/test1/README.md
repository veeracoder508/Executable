# test1
this is the the first stage of executable.
## split.py
in class `Code()` there are functions
```python
__init__(self, file_path = "test.txt", dev = True)
read_and_separate_words(self)
compile(self)
__str__(self)
__repr__(self)
```
the `__init__()` gets the `file_path` of the .txt file in which the program is writen in.

the `read_and_separate_words()` splits the code that python can understand.

the `compile` compiles the split code.
